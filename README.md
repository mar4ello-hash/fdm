# About the Game

This is the Pattern Recognition mini game. Most of the game was developed using React. It has a simple functionality, where all you need to do is find two tiles of the same pattern. For the found pair you get points, which you can see in the left corner of your screen. The only complications in the game are a time limit of 2 minutes and a possible rotation of the second tile by 90degrees. The timer is located directly under the game window and is displayed as a line. After you find all the pairs on your screen, the level will automatically change. The pattern on the tiles will become more difficult with each level. Your task is to find as many pairs as possible until the timer goes off, thereby earning as many points as possible. The game is designed in such way that you can easily change the number of levels, timer time or the number of pairs to be found. New features can be added just as easily. All drawings I painted myself using a regular Paint program. When the time runs out, a window pops up on the screen, which shows your nickname and the points you earned. If you manage to complete all the levels before the timer ends, you will also be shown how many seconds are left. Player data is not transferred to the database, but this can be easily fixed. Also, on the pop-up window you can see two buttons, one to restart the game, and the second to go back to the main menu. The game came out pretty simple, but enjoyable to play. I liked developing it and I am glad that in the end my main task was accomplished.
